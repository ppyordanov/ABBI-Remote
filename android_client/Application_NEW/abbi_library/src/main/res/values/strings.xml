                                <i>An Android application used to control the ABBI bracelet developed by IIT
                                 (Italian Institute of Technology). The project will follow the client-server software development paradigm.
                                  The server is going to be tied to a central data store and communicate with the Android app via a REST API.</i>]]></string>
